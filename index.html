        everyone—wants some of it.
        We want
        respect in our personal lives and in our professional lives as well. We want to be appreciated for the work we
        do and to get proper recognition for our contributions. When our colleagues respect us, they take us more
        seriously and view us as professionals who get things done in the right way while applying professional
        standards and ethics. If you want to be respected more by your boss, your staff or your colleagues, you
        absolutely must do these seven things consistently.</p>
      <p>By all means, don`t apologize excessively. Doing so might cause people to see you as inferior, especially when
        your inclination is to automatically apologize to others for not only the stuff you get wrong but for the stuff
        they get wrong too.</p>
